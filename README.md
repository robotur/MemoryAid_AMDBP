# MemoryAid — AMD Blueprint Competition

MemoryAid is a compact and affordable digital notetaker designed for moments when ideas appear suddenly. Instead of reaching for a phone or notebook, users can record a note instantly from a small device worn or kept close at hand. It aims to support people who often forget tasks or lose track of ideas by giving them a simple and reliable tool.

## Overview

- **Instant Access:** The device can be clipped to clothing, a bag, or kept near the mouth so notes can be taken the moment something comes to mind.
- **Small & Low Cost:** Built with inexpensive components and a minimal design to keep it lightweight, discreet, and easy to carry.
- **Voice-Based Input:** Users can record short notes with a single button press or quick voice activation, removing the need for screens or menus.
- **Straightforward Storage:** Notes are saved digitally for later review or transfer to another device.

## Why MemoryAid?

Many people lose track of ideas simply because writing them down takes too long. MemoryAid solves this by being always within reach and ready in seconds, preserving information exactly as the user remembers it.

## Goal

To provide an accessible, practical, and low-effort way to capture and preserve information, helping users manage their time and daily tasks more effectively.
